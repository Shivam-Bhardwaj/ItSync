feat: Implement GUI for sync tool with auto-start and file logging

Introduces a CustomTkinter-based graphical user interface for managing
real-time, one-way directory synchronization tasks.

Key features in this update:
- Main application window to display and manage sync tasks.
- Dialog to add new tasks with source and multiple destination selection.
- Persistent storage of task configurations in 'sync_config.json'.
- Tasks run in background threads using 'watchdog' for monitoring.
- Auto-start functionality:
    - Tasks loaded from config are started on application launch.
    - Newly added tasks are started by default.
- Controls for starting/stopping individual or all tasks.
- Functionality to remove selected or all tasks with confirmation.
- Logging to both console and a rotating file in 'Documents/SyncAppLogs/sync_app.log'.
- UI improvements, including better font consistency in dialogs.
- Updated README and CHANGELOG to reflect GUI implementation.
