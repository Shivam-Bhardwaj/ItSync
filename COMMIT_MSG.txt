feat: Add 'Remove All Tasks', file logging, and UI/UX improvements

This update introduces several enhancements to the Python GUI sync tool:

- **Remove All Tasks:** Added a button to the sidebar allowing users to remove
  all configured sync tasks after confirmation. This includes stopping any
  active tasks before clearing the configuration.
- **File Logging:** Implemented logging to a rotating file
  (`Documents/SyncAppLogs/sync_app.log`) in addition to console output.
  This provides a persistent record of application activity and errors.
- **Auto-start New Tasks:** Newly added tasks now attempt to start
  synchronization automatically by default.
- **UI Font Consistency:** Improved the font size in the destination folder
  listbox within the "Add Task" dialog to better match other UI elements.
- **Desktop Shortcut Preparation:** Discussed and prepared for packaging the
  application as a standalone executable (e.g., using PyInstaller) to allow
  running without a separate console window and for easier shortcut creation.
- Minor refinements to task stopping logic and button state updates.
