feat: Implement real-time sync tool in Python using watchdog

Replaces the previous C++ implementation attempt with a Python version
utilizing the 'watchdog' library for filesystem monitoring and standard
'os' and 'shutil' modules for file operations.

Key Features:
- Monitors source directory recursively for create, delete, modify, move events.
- Performs initial full sync from source to destination(s).
- Replicates changes to one or more destination directories.
- Includes basic logging.
- Takes source and destination paths as command-line arguments.
